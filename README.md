# imageExtractor
A python script for web scrapping. This script extracts all the figures in a web page


**Description:**
A client asked me to remodel his company's website. The company sells plumbing supplies and they have a large inventory of over 100 items on their site.
The client did not provide me with the information in JSON format to display it on the new site because the client has no programming skills.
So I made this little script to extract all the images of each figure, along with the figcaptions and h3 of each article.
Then, all this information is saved in a JSON to implement it in the FrontEnd for the new website.


- Out of respect for my client's privacy I removed the URL ,which you must change with the one you want to extract.
- It is important that the site you want to extract has 'figure' tags.
- The variable 'headers' is necessary to prevent our bot from being detected by some sites, especially if they are wordpress sites.


I hope this script will be of great help to the community.
